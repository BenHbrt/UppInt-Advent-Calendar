# Upper-Intermediate Advent Calendar

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the project

I wrote this project as as part of my GitHub portfolio. As I have a background in English language teaching, I thought that it would be a good idea to create an educaional Advent calendar, which would provide the user with a new phonemic symbol and question each day.

I designed this calendar for a hypothetical group of Slavic language speakers, and so selected phonemic symbols which represented sounds they often find difficult to produce or which have symbols which may be difficult to connect to the sounds which they represent.

## The tech side of things

I decided to write this project using the React library, as it was clear to me that it lends itself to the use of components for the different days, as thy all needed to behave in the same way. I chose to use SCSS for the styling, as it allows for nested syntax, thus making it much easier to write.
